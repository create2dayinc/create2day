<h3><a name="birthday-in-a-box">Birthday in a Box</a></h3>
<p>​Do you remember your childhood?</p>
<p>The excitement of opening gift on your birthday and holidays and
blowing out candles on your beautiful birthday cake?</p>
<p>Nothing symbolizes a birthday more than a cake adorned with candles and a gift.</p>
<p>Yet while many of us take a birthday cake and presents for granted, there are children who miss out receiving this simple, yet special, pleasure on their big day. In economically challenged homes, birthday cakes and presents are sometimes an unaffordable luxury when compared to competing priorities for medicine, clothes, and rent.  As a result, many children living in poverty or in shelters do not have birthday parties to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>Create</strong> wants to ensure that the needy children have those joyful experiences as well by providing cakes and distributing new toys and gently-used toys, games, dolls, and books; bringing smiles to young faces. </p>
<p>Children need experiences in which they are shown that they are valued. When kids see a birthday cake with their name on it, they know that the occasion is just for them. </p>
<p>Doesn't every child deserve to have that moment of being the star?  We think so; so our "Birthday In a Box" Program was born.</p>
<p>This program is for children that are in Shelters or Foster Homes. Some of these children have not been able to enjoy a Birthday or have a Birthday Party.</p>
<p>With your help and donations, we provide the children a cake and presents wrapped festively for the occasion. These are put in a large box and again wrapped appropriately at which time the box is delivered according to security guidelines. 
We prefer new toys and items for this program. Our proceeds and donations cover the cost of gifts, and cakes are made by volunteers who support the program. See our donations page for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="gifts-for-seniors">Gifts for Seniors</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately some of our seniors are spending their later years in nursing homes. Once there, some feel they are no longer important or necessary.  </p>
<p>Create wants them to know they are still loved and thought of. Please help us provide small celebrations of the birthday or holiday.</p>
<p>These gifts include heartwarming cards, small gifts, and various crafts made in our store.</p>
