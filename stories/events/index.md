- **Studio Time:** Students who want to use the studio machines and materials and get a few tips but don't need guided instruction can make an appointment to use the space for $7/hour at select times.
- **Beginner sewing classes:** ever sewn before? That's ok!  We can teach you everything you need to get started.  We offer basic sewing lessons to children 8 and above.
