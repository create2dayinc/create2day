We offer many machines and materials to learn, teach, and create wearable pieces of art! Please send us an email at <create2dayinc@gmail.com>.

- **Personalized sewing sessions:** Learn at your own pace through a progression of personalized workshops, or get personalized help with your own projects. Opportunities exist to use the studio with or without instruction.
- **Studio Time:** Students who want to use the studio machines and materials and get a few tips but don't need guided instruction can make an appointment to use the space for $7/hour at select times.
- **Beginner sewing classes:** ever sewn before? That's ok!  We can teach you everything you need to get started.  We offer basic sewing lessons to children 8 and above.
